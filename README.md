### Overview
CSE592 Project (2015 Fall) - Politics of Routing 

### Requirements
#### Step 1: Produce sub-graphs of the Internet's topology for each country. 
* CAIDA AS topology
* PCI (packet clearing house)
* RIPE and Routeviews BGP data
 
#### Step 2: Compute different graph theoretic metrics for each country. 

* Consider various features
 - minimum
 - average
 - median
 - degree
 - clustering coeffient
 - diameter
 - degree of international connectivity.

#### Step 3: Use machine learning to cluster the countries based on the graph properties. 

* Pick a machine learning algorithm (or investigate a few of them) to cluster the countries based on the clusters
* Investigate different combinations of algorithms and metrics of produced clusters.

#### Step 4: Analyze results

* Relationship between AS-level connectivity, Internet freedom/politics and economic considerations of the countries. 
* What graph metric causes this?
